Figure : The enclosed Pressure and Saturation contour plots correspond to the simulation of the Nechelik reservoir (80 X 75 cells) with 6 wells (2 horizontal, 4 vertical) for 1000 days with a time step of 0.1 days. After 500 days, water is being injected into two wells on the bottom left for secondary recovery.

### Dependences

The codes and live scripts requires the Matlab.

### Quick Usage
After cloning the repository, run the Matlab files directly.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to acknowledge Professor Marc Hesse for teaching the course in 2021 and providing the basic codes. The course website has most of the theory circumscribing these codes which can be found [here](https://mhesse.github.io/numerical_modeling/Spring2021.html).
